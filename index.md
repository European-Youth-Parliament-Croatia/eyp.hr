  headline: About <strong>EYP Croatia</strong></span>
  content: U Hrvatskoj je EPMH (Europski parlament mladih Hrvatske) osnovan 1994. godine. Od početka aktivnosti, EPMH je organizirao brojne EYP dane, 8 regionalnih zasjedanja, 26 nacionalnih, 2 međunarodna zasjedanja i 1 međunarodni forum. </br></br>U te 22 godine i više od 40 održanih zasjedanja kroz našu je organizaciju prošlo preko 5 000 mladih ljudi željnih znanja, putovanja i zabave. Osim velikog utjecaja na regionalnoj razini, EPMH-u je čak dva puta dodijeljeno povjerenje od strane središnjeg ureda EPM-a u Berlinu za organiziranje međunarodnog zasjedanja – najvećeg i najznačajnijeg događaja unutar udruge.

  headline: Random <strong>naslov</strong></span>
  content: The organisation hosts a variety of events, but the main ones are regional, national and international sessions. Regional sessions are the ones where the delegates are introduced to the organisation’s work through a simulation of a real parliamentary session. The best ones are selected to join the national sessions which happen once or twice per year in all of the national branches, where the best are chosen to represent their communities, cultures and states at the international sessions, the biggest events hosted by the organisation.
